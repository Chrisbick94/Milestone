ODU-SD-04 Milestone Project: Web-Browser DX-Ball (Brick Breaker Game)
https://chrisbick94.github.io/Milestone/
Project Description
My project here will be to make an interactive Brick Breaker game inspired by the old 90s game DX-Ball that is accessible through your web-browsers. It will be the same as the orginal game that we know and love. Of course, as this is a beginners project it will not have all the functionality of the original game you may be familiar with but my goal is to get as close to that as possible.

Game Logic
The game will consist of a number of levels that you can interact with and break different types of blocks.
There will be one player vs other blocks
There will be different models and colors.
The code will be written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
Deliverables
Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term Minimum Viable Product (MVP) -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.

Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as Post-MVP Ideas. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!

For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

MVP Criteria
Play as chess normally would.
Switch off between white team and black team each time a piece is moved. Preventing two moves in a turn.
Have the ability to choose what team to play for in the beginning.
Have the ability to be randomly selected for a team if the player does not wish to choose the team.

Another thing.
Etc.
Post-MVP Plans
Add an AI PVE option so that players can practice alone without the need of a second player.
Create a ranking system that will scale the difficulty of the AI.
Maybe even making publicly accesible so players can play other real people instead of AI. Real-time match making.
